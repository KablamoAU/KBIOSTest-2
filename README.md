###iOS test 2

###Instructions
Please build an iPhone application that displays a native map control with the following features:
* Using the data set found within dataset.xls, drop a series of pins on the map using lat & lon of each POI
* The data can be uploaded and accessed via a web service, the server technology being of your choosing
* The map should center over the pins, at an appropriate zoom level to view all the pins
* The pins should have a popup that contains the description / title of the pin
* The pins should have a custom animation of some description, eg. Bubbling up from the ground as opposed to dropping from the top

The application should support both iPhone 4 & 5 devices in portrait or landscape orientations.

We want to see how you build the application, you may use 3rd party libraries for any data request & processing, just please highlight which ones you have chosen. 

Please fork this repo to your personal Github account, and once complete allow us with access to your repo.

When submitting your test, please specify any tools you have used, including the editor you used to write your code, and the instruments used to test performance.

###General requirements and considerations
Generally, you should build this app in the way that you feel it should be built, however the following should be taken into consideration: 

* Memory: 
Ensure that the application is properly handles memory as efficiently as necessary.

* Standards compliance: 
Ensure that your code utilises apples standards for naming conventions, and only publicly available API's are used.
